+cloud security services:
saas,paas,iaas

+shared responsibility model
if we talk about software as a service mean that we specific control on software.

if we talk about infrastructure as a service will be like deploy the os on provide cloud service.
so we can manage all the platform, network and software.

+cloud security control

chaining attack:

1. recon - motivation
2. weaponize - packaging and configuration
3. delivery - infection the user
4. exploitation - method and characteristic
5. installation - perssistant
6. c2 - communication between victim 
7. action and objective - adversary activity

+when we have cloud instance for ie web application, in the first stage hacker will try to find the information such as version
of our instance down to database from the public information that they get from our web application. they will try to gather
the exposure information.

+weaponise the attacker will prepare the payload or injection for the deliver to the victim.

+delivery will be all the places such as email.

+exploitation and install then they will do reverse connection as C2

security control:

+ stop recon:

- policies and procedure
- firewall
- cyberawareness

+ stop weaponise

- threat and vulnerability mgmt

+ stop delivery

- anti virus
- web proxy
- mobile device mgmt
- directory service

+ stop exploitation

- antivirus
- ids
- edr
